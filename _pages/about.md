Iâ€™m Liam, a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I currently work with [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I also recieved a B.S.E. in Computer Engineering and M.S.E. in Robotics here at Penn. 

My research focuses primarily on large language models and how humans interact with them. In particular, I am interested in analyzing how well humans can detect generated text and building robust automatic detection systems. I am also interested in the practical application of large language models to education as well as machine translation (both text and speech).

My current work includes:

- Optimizing Machine Translation for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval
- Analyzing whether or not humans can detect generated text from GPT-2 and GPT-3
- Automatic Question Generation for "Smart Textbooks"
- Low latency End-to-End Speech Translation

Outside of academia, I like to play chess, run, and study foreign languages. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research or the PhD application process!
