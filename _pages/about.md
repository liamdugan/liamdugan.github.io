Hey! Iâ€™m Liam, a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with the [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) group. I am advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). 

My research focuses primarily on large language models and how humans interact with them. In particular, I am interested in analyzing how humans detect generated text and if we can apply those insights to automatic detection systems. I am also interested in the practical application of large language models to education.

My current work includes:

- Analyzing human and automatic detection of generated text
- Automatic Question Generation for "Smart Textbooks"
- Developing low latency End-to-End Speech Translation

Outside of academia, I like to play chess, run, and study foreign languages. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research or the PhD application process!
