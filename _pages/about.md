Hey! Iâ€™m Liam, a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with the [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) group. I am advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). 

My research focuses primarily on human and automated detection of AI-generated content. In particular, I am interested in the limitations of detection tools and strategies for deploying detectors with minimal harm. My co-authors and I maintain the [Real or Fake Text](http://roft.io) website where people can test how well they can detect generated text. We also recently released the [RAID Benchmark](https://raid-bench.xyz/) the largest and most challenging benchmark for automatic generated text detectors. Feel free to check these resources out yourself to both test your detection skill and compare popular detectors!

This semester (Fall 2024) I am co-organizer of the Penn [Computational Linguistics Lunch (CLunch)](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/clunch.html) Seminar as well as leading the Penn Statistical NLP Reading Group.

My previous work has included:
- Customizing Machine Translation systems for Cross-Lingual Question Answering
- Automatic Question Generation for "Smart Textbooks"
- Developing low latency End-to-End Speech Translation

Outside of academia, I like to play [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/liam-dugan), [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43873251), and [study foreign languages](https://www.wanikani.com/users/Liam-Dugan). Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research or the PhD application process!
