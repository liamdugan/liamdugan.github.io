Hey! Iâ€™m Liam, a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with the [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) group. I am advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). 

My research focuses on human and automated detection of AI-generated content. In particular, I am interested in the [technical limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07940) and [societal ramifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12672) of detection tools and how we might deploy such detectors with minimal harm. My work has been featured by news organizations such as [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/business/detect-ai-text-human-writing/), [ABC News](https://wcti12.com/news/newschannel-12-investigates-artificial-intelligence-part-3), and [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-moderators-brace-for-a-chatgpt-spam-apocalypse/) as well as in a [testimony](https://youtu.be/geapV9EKW0k?si=C7X5vBdinRtPT85J) to the U.S. Congress.

My co-authors and I maintain the [Real or Fake Text](http://roft.io) website where people can test how well they can detect generated text. We also recently released the [RAID Benchmark](https://raid-bench.xyz/) the largest and most challenging benchmark for automatic generated text detectors. Feel free to check these resources out yourself to both test your detection skill and compare popular detectors!

My previous work has included:
- Customizing Machine Translation systems for Cross-Lingual Question Answering
- Automatic Question Generation for "Smart Textbooks"
- Developing low latency End-to-End Speech Translation

Outside of academia, I like to play [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/liam-dugan), [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43873251), and [study foreign languages](https://www.wanikani.com/users/Liam-Dugan). Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research or the PhD application process!

This semester (Fall 2024) I am organizing the weekly Penn [Computational Linguistics Lunch (CLunch)](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/clunch.html) Seminar and the Penn Statistical NLP Reading Group. Please reach out if you are a current Penn student and are interested in joining!
