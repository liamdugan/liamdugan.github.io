Hey! Iâ€™m Liam, a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with the [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) group. I am advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). **I am currently interning at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in New York City for Summer + Fall 2025.** Previously I have spent time at [Roblox](https://research.roblox.com/) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).

My research focuses on human and automated detection of AI-generated content. In particular, I am interested in the [technical limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07940) and [societal ramifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12672) of detection tools and how we might deploy AI detectors with minimal harm. My work has been featured by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/business/detect-ai-text-human-writing/), [ABC News](https://wcti12.com/news/newschannel-12-investigates-artificial-intelligence-part-3), and [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-moderators-brace-for-a-chatgpt-spam-apocalypse/) as well as in a [testimony](https://youtu.be/geapV9EKW0k?si=C7X5vBdinRtPT85J) to the U.S. Congress.

My co-authors and I maintain the [Real or Fake Text](http://roft.io) website where people can test how well they can detect generated text. We also maintain the [RAID Benchmark](https://raid-bench.xyz/) the largest and most challenging dataset for comparing generated text detectors.

My previous work has included:
- Customizing Machine Translation systems for Cross-Lingual Question Answering
- Automatic Question Generation for "Smart Textbooks"
- Developing low latency Speech-to-Speech Translation

Outside of academia, I like to play [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/liam-dugan), [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43873251), and [study foreign languages](https://www.wanikani.com/users/Liam-Dugan). Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research or the PhD application process!
