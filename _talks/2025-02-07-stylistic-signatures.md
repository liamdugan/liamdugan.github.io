### Abstract
In this talk I summarize what we know and understand about the stylistic tendencies of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a linguistic and statistical perspective. I also discuss both why it is unintuitive that LLMs have a style to begin with and some theories as to where those stylistic tendencies actually originate from. I conclude by discussing the implications this has on our ability to robustly identify AI-generated text.

### Location
This talk was given on February 7th, 2025 at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA as part of the weekly [Integrated Language Science and Technology (ILST) Seminar](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/).
