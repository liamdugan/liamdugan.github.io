### Abstract
In this talk I discuss my work on evaluating and improving the robustness of multimodal AI detection systems. I show that while AI detectors seem to thrive in in-domain settings, they frequently fail to generalize to generative models, domains, and adversarial attacks not seen at training time. I also discuss how we may be able to use bottlenecks to overcome these limitations. In addition, I show how we can tune classification thresholds to help combat fairness issues in classifiers. Finally, I end with a vision for the future real world application of detectors and how we should embed these models in larger systems to prevent downstream harms.

### Location
