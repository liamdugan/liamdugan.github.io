### Abstract
In this talk I describe the current benefits and limitations of techniques for direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST). I discuss the work I did at Roblox on speaker-preserving cascaded speech to text translation systems and adaptations made to such systems to allow for simultaneous inference. I finish by outlining methods for preserving prosody through text and discuss the steps that need to be taken in order to develop robust direct S2ST systems.

### Location
This talk was given on May 5th 2023 at the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE) at John's Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland as part of their Bi-weekly work in progress talk seminar.
