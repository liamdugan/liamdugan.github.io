### Abstract
In this talk my project teammates and I present our work developing an asymmetric two-player game where one person plays as the robot operator and another plays as the dungeon master. For this project we built Todd: The Inter-Dimensional Robot from a breadboard, an arduino, and a HC-05 Bluetooth micro-controller. We match up the movements of the robot in the real world to the movements of the robot in-game and show how this can be the basis of an engaging two-player game. 

### Location
This presentation was given on September 11th 2017 in the Berger Auditorium at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia PA as part of the [16th Annual PennApps Hackathon](https://pennapps-xvi.devpost.com/). Our team won 3rd place out of 158 teams and each recieved a Gen 1 Apple Watch as a prize.
