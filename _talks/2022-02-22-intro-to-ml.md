### Abstract
In this talk I give a brief introduction to the topic of machine learning at a high-school level. I start by discussing basic neural network architectures and continue on to explain how gradient descent is computed as well as the factors leading to the recent rise in popularity of machine learning techniques. I finish by discussing the various applications of machine learning and a brief overview of my own research as well as going over what the day-to-day life of a PhD student looks like.

### Location
This talk was given on February 2nd 2022 to the students of AP Computer Science at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia, PA.
