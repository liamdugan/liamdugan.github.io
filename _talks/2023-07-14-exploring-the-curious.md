### Abstract
In this talk I describe our work investigating the utility of code prompting for general unstructured reasoning tasks. We find that code prompts do surprisingly well, especially on classification-style tasks. While preliminary, our results carve out space for future work to dig deep and investigate the area of code prompting more thoroughly.

### Location
This talk was given on July 14th 2023 at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto Canada as part of the [Workshop for Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations](https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/) at ACL 2023.
