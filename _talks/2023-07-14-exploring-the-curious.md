In this talk I describe our work investigating whether or not code prompts are useful for general NLP tasks. We find that code prompts do surprisingly well, especially on classification-style tasks that require heavy reasoning skills. While preliminary, our results carve out space for future work to dig deep and investigate the area of code prompting more thoroughly.

This talk was given on July 14th 2023 at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto Canada as part of the [Workshop for Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations (NLRSE) at ACL](https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/).
