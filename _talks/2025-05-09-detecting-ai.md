### Abstract
In this talk I discuss the difficulties in applying AI detectors to real world high-stakes scenarios. I discuss the stylistic components that make up AI's style and how despite being able to detect these traces we are a long way from being able to robustly deploy these systems in any meaningful capacity. I finish by discussing how we may begin to use alternative signals to help aid AI detection when confidence is low.

### Location
This talk was given on May 9th, 2025 at Drexel University in Philadelphia as a guest lecture for the Artificial Intelligence class.
